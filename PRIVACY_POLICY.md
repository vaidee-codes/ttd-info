# Privacy Policy for TTD Autofill Assistant

**Last Updated:** December 24, 2025

The **TTD Autofill Assistant** ("we", "our", or "us") is a Chrome Extension designed to assist users in autofilling forms on the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) booking website. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data with transparency.

## 1. Information We Collect and Store

We do **not** collect, transmit, or store any of your personal information on our servers. All data you enter into the extension stays entirely on your local device.

### Local Data Storage
The extension uses your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save the following details for your convenience:
- **Pilgrim Details:** Names, ages, genders, ID proof numbers, and related passport information (country, visa details).
- **Contact Details:** Email addresses, mailing addresses, city, state, and pincodes.

This data is stored solely to allow you to reuse it for future bookings without re-entering it.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

The information you save is used exclusively for the Single Purpose of autofilling booking forms on the official TTD websites (`tirupatibalaji.ap.gov.in`, `ttdevasthanams.ap.gov.in`, etc.).

- **Autofill:** When you click the "Fill" buttons, the extension reads your locally saved data and populates the fields on the active webpage.
- **No External Transmission:** We do not send your data to any third-party servers, analytics platforms, or ad networks. Your data never leaves your browser.

## 3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Since we do not collect your data, we have no data to share.
- We do **not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to outside parties.
- We do **not** use your data for creditworthiness, lending, or any other unrelated purposes.

## 4. Your Control Over Data

You retain full ownership and control over your data:
- **View/Edit:** You can view or update your saved data at any time via the extension's popup interface.
- **Delete:** You can delete individual pilgrim entries or clear all contact details directly within the extension. Removing the extension from Chrome will also permanently delete all locally stored data associated with it.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.

## 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
